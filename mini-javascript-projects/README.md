Most projects are client-side and can be run by following these steps:

1.  Navigate to a specific project's directory (e.g., `cd weather-app`).
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

For projects requiring API keys (like the Weather App) or special setup (like the Node.js scripts), please refer to the `README.md` file inside that specific project's folder for detailed instructions.
